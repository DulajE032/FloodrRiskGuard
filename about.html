            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to provide accessible, real-time flood risk data for students, researchers, and communities. We aim to foster better preparedness and a deeper understanding of environmental hazards through technology.</p>
            
            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>FloodGuard offers an interactive platform that combines live weather data with geographic information to produce accurate flood risk assessments. Users can select any point on the map to receive instant details about temperature, humidity, and precipitation, along with a calculated flood risk level for that specific area.</p>

            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>We are a team of developers, data scientists, and environmental enthusiasts passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. This project was born from a desire to make critical environmental data easy to access and understand for everyone.</p>
